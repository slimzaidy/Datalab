# Datalab

These are my solutions for the exercises from the Datalab master's course at the Technical University of Braunschweig.

During this practical course, the students develop their own AI systems for IT security. This includes learning systems for detecting attacks, 
analyzing malware and uncovering vulnerabilities. The practical course deepens the knowledge and skills acquired in the "Machine Learning in 
IT Security" module. The students design, develop and implement their own solutions with data from practice.
